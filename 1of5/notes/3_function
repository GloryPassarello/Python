FUNCTIONS
Function in Python are like in R.

Structure
	def   my_function():
	    defining my_function

def		with it, we are saying to python that we are going to define a new function
		def is for defining
my_function	it's the name of the function we are defining
()		inside parenthesis we put the variable we want (like in R)
warming		Keep in mind the indent necessary in python 

All the reserved word are built-in function:
they have a code written inside and with a reserved word the code is quicker
