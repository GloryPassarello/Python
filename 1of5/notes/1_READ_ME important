If you want to run a script on UBUNTU you MUST always write as first line

TO RUN A PYTHON SCRIPT
	#!/usr/bin/env python

TO RUN A BASH SCRIPT
	#!/bin/bash


Otherwise Bash won't know which program to use for the run 
you will visualize "Syntax error"


In python you cannot use tabs
IF you do it, you will have an INDENTATION ERROR
