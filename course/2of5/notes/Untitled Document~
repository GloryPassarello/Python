Tuples are collections, another type of collection 
so now we have:
list=[]
dictionary={}
tuple=()

TUPLES

- they are like list, they contein object with
- they are like the strings they are IMMUTABLE they cannot be changed


dir()		I can figure out what I could do with that object

why are tuples are so important?
-they are more efficient (save processing time) 
I can create a tuple with two assignments
 example 
(x, y) = (4, 'fred')
o we can delete the parentensis
x, y = (4, 'fred')
