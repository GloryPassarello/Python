Tuples are collections, another type of collection 
so now we have:
list=[]
dictionary={}
tuple=()

TUPLES

- they are like list, they contein object with
- they are like the strings they are IMMUTABLE they cannot be changed
- they are COMPERABLE 


dir()		I can figure out what I could do with that object

why are tuples are so important?
-they are more efficient (save processing time) 
I can create a tuple with two assignments
 example 
(x, y) = (4, 'fred')
o we can delete the parentensis
x, y = (4, 'fred')

when I use the dic.item function I create a tuples


with tuples I can:
- compare things
- sort things
usually I can sort by keys but there is a trick in python to sort with the values.
