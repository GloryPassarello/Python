sqlite3 module

to use it you must create a connection 

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
:memory: to create the database in RAM

all the data will stored in example.db

after connection:

c= conn.cursor()	#create a cursor object
c.execute()		#we can call a method to execute the SQL query


c.fetchone()		#Fetches the next row of a query result set, returning a single sequence, or None when no more data is available.

conn.commit()		#This method commits the current transaction. If you don’t call this method, anything you did since the last call to commit() is not visible from other database connections. If you wonder why you don’t see the data you’ve written to the database, please check you didn’t forget to call this method.

c.close()		#close the connection

if you want to use values from Python variables you have to use the DB-API's parameter substitution

t = ('RHAT',)
c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol=?', t)
