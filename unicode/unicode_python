keep in mind that 'str' are in the end bytes.

unicode is for string: 

for example: 
u'Bld Mohamed V, Essaouira, Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz Region, Morocco'

the u before the string 'Bld Mohamed V, Essaouira, Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz Region, Morocco' stands for unicode


UTF-8	is an encoding like ASCII

The difference is that the UTF-8 encoding can represent every Unicode character, while the ASCII encoding can’t


###Useful Unicode tools###


    - encode(): Gets you from Unicode -> bytes
    - decode(): Gets you from bytes -> Unicode
    - codecs.open(encoding=”utf-8″): Read and write files directly to/from Unicode (you can use any encoding, not just utf-8, but utf-8 is most common).
    . u”: Makes your string literals into Unicode objects rather than byte sequences.
