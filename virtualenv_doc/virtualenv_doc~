#create virtual environment folder
virtualenv ENV

ENV is the directory name of the new environment
it can be anything



- ENV/lib/ and ENV/include/ are created, containing supporting library files for a new virtualenv python. Packages installed in this environment will live under ENV/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/.

- ENV/bin is created, where executables live - noticeably a new python. Thus running a script with #! /path/to/ENV/bin/python would run that script under this virtualenvâ€™s python.

- The crucial packages pip and setuptools are installed, which allow other packages to be easily installed to the environment. This associated pip can be run from ENV/bin/pip
