lists in python are iterable

mylist = [1, 2, 3]
mylist = (x*x for x in range(3))
for i in mylist:
	print i

mylist now it is a generator and they are stored in memory

GENERATORS

they are iterators and you can only iterate them one: it is becourse they do not save value in the memory

yield id like return except for the function will return a generator
