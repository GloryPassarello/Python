for a client:
it only need to do:
my_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
my_sock.connet(("host", port))


#create an INET, STREAMing socket
s = socket.socket(
    socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#now connect to the web server on port 80
# - the normal http port
s.connect(("www.mcmillan-inc.com", 80))


from a web server is a bit more complex


#create an INET, STREAMing socket
serversocket = socket.socket(
    socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#bind the socket to a public host,
# and a well-known port
serversocket.bind((socket.gethostname(), 80))
#become a server socket
serversocket.listen(5)



AF_INET 
is an address family.
it indicateds the type of addresses
