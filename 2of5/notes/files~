open()		built-in function used to open files
		if the file is quite hugen python does not read the entire file 
		open(name[, mode[, buffering]])
		name= name of the file to be opened, mandatory
		mode= how the file will be opened
			r  reading mode
			w  writing mode
			a  appending
		if you specify nothing, python will open your file on reading mode  

		BE CAREFULL WITH THAT: IF YOU RE_USE THE SAME COMMANDS PYTHON WILL REFRESH THE FILE STORED ON THE MAIN MEMORY (LIKE IN R)

read()		it can be used on a invocation mode. 
		For example: imp=file.read()
				we created a object on python on we can use the function len().
		The file is stored on the RAM (main memory) so it is recommended to use it for small files.

write()		It allows to write on a handle file.
		We should open it with writing mode. 
		example:  
			file= open('file.txt', 'w')
			line='this line is gonna to be added on the file'
			file.write(line)		
			file.close() #we need to close the file but before be sure that we wrote on it what we want

\n		stays for a new line 
		a new line is one character
\t		it stays for a tab
		it is one character
\r

handle file 	is a temporary file, that is read by python but not written on the main memory (like R when it reads data)
		I cannot use the function len() with a handle file 




#####COUNTING A LINE#####

file= open(text.txt)
count=0
for line in file:
	count= count + 1
print 'Line count: ',count


file.read() 	(invocation) I can read the text of the file in one line
		in this case I can use the len() function
