len()			return the length of a object
			argument: sequence (string, tuple, list, range) a collection (dictionary, set)

dir()			with argument, it shows which names a module define on a sorted list of strings.
			without argument, it shows the names you have defined before.
			It also shoews what you can do with that type of object
			
help()			it does information about a function (like in bash)

repr()			It allows to manage spaces, tabs and new lines. they are invisible to use.
			With that function we have a printable representation of an object 

all the string method above are written with the invocation format

				###BUILT-IN FUNCTION STRING

str.find()		allows to know the position of a character or a sub string within a string.
str.upper()		capitilizes each character in given string
str.replace()		replaces a character or a letter in a given string
str.lower()		converts strings to the lower case.
str.startswith()	checks if a string begin with that character or not
str.rstrip()		removes white spaces from the right side of the calling string 
str.lstrip()		removes white spaces from the left side of the calling string
str.strip()		removes whitespases from the end and the beginning if the chars is ometted or None
			otherwise all the combination of the string on it are stripped
str.close()		closes a handle file obteined with open() command
str.read()		read the file into memory
str.split()		return a *list* of the words in the string

				###BUILT-IN FUNCTION LIST###

			more information on https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/datastructures.html

range()			returns a list of number from 0 to n-1 where n is the lenght of the list

del t[1]		it is an operator not a function
			it deletes the 2nd element of the list t
			it can be used with a slice index		

list.append()		Adds an item to the end of the list. it is a void function.
list.extend()		adds a list (t2) to the end of another list (t1)
			t1.extend(t2)	#t2 is unmodified
list.insert(i,x)	inserts an item at a given position
list.remove()		it removes the element from a list.
			as object you will have an element
			
list.pop([])		deletes a element of a list with its index (that's why we have the brackets [])
			in addiction return the element that was removed from the list
			if you do not provide an index, it deletes and return the last element

list.index()		returns the index in the list of the first item whose value is x
			s.index(x[, i[, j]]) 
			return smallest k such that s[k] == x and i <= k < j

list.count()		returns the number of count that a x element apears in the list
list.sort()		arranges element of the list from low to high
list.reverse()		reverses the places of the elements of the list 
list.max()		returns the maximum on the list
list.min()		returns the minimum on the list
list.sum()		returns the sum of the list
