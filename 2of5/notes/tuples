Tuples are collections
Type of collection 
list=[]
dictionary={}
tuple=()

- they are like list, they contein object with
- they are like the strings they are IMMUTABLE they cannot be changed
- they are COMPERABLE 
- Syntactically, they are a comma-separeted list of values
- Python uses parentesis to identify them quickly
- If I want to create a tuple with a single value, I have to add a single comma in the end
	t1=('a',)
	that's why python,if we didn't add the comma, would identify t1 as a string.

        BUILT-IN FUNCTION

dir()		I can figure out what I could do with that object
tuple()		creates a tuple 

dic.tuple()	create a LIST of tuples whome can be sorted bacause it is a list and not a tuple anymore

COMPARINSON
-python compares the first element



why are tuples are so important?
-they are more efficient (save processing time) 
I can create a tuple with two assignments
 example 
(x, y) = (4, 'fred')
o we can delete the parentensis
x, y = (4, 'fred')
